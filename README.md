# Project_1

## Synopsis
We created a webpage where we connect with three APIs to present useful information to the user.

## Motivation
Below is a quick summary to recap things that you can expect:

1) What problem does your app focus on?
Finding events in a specific city and letting the user save the ones that he/she is interested in.

2) How does your app solve this problem at a high-level?
Our site gives the user an extensive drop-down list of cities that he/she can choose from. Once that city is selected, a list of the top 10 most popular events (per Eventful) will appear for that selected city. From here, the user has the capability to add any events that he/she may be interested in.

3) What steps did you take to build the app?
We quickly found out how often the CORS errors come up, so we focused on finding any APIs that we were able to get data from without the use of a server, and then tried to connect them into one theme. Because of the difficulty in finding APIs that worked for us, we completed the front-end first. Once we were actually able to get data from these APIs, we added classes/IDs to the front-end as needed and just had people working on separate JS files until one feature was completed. THen we made sure to merge them together so that they created one responsive page.

4) Features to be added:
Authorization/login page for Firebase so it is unique to the user.
A more extensive display of the Weather (currently only shows the weather for today but the events are for multiple days)
Convert the time in the Eventful API from military to standard?
